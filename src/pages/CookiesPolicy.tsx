                    <p>
                      Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. You can choose to remove or reject cookies through your
                      browser‚Äôs settings. Please note that disabling cookies may affect the availability and functionality of some

                      In addition to cookies, we may use other tracking technologies such as web beacons and pixel tags. These are tiny

                      descriptions of the page or email where they appear. While web beacons and pixel tags cannot be individually
                      declined, you can limit their effect by managing the cookies that interact with them.
